//! The corpus generator, vendored from the engram evaluation harness
//! (`eval/src/generate.rs` at the revision KnowledgeDrift v1 was cut from)
//! so that every v1 world regenerates from this repository alone. The v1
//! worlds under `worlds/v1/` are the benchmark; this module is their
//! provenance, and a test asserts it still reproduces their digests.
//!
//! The corpus generator.
//!
//! Every fact is about an **invented** subject ("Kelnor lease broker"), so no
//! model can answer it from pretraining and no agent can answer it from having
//! read this repo. The answer arrives through retrieval or it does not arrive.
//! That is the whole point: it makes the measurement immune to the bias that
//! sinks every dogfood benchmark.
//!
//! Every vocabulary carries two columns — the wording the fact uses, and a
//! word-disjoint paraphrase used only by oblique questions. That is what lets
//! an oblique question describe a fact without sharing its vocabulary, which
//! is the only way to tell semantic retrieval apart from keyword matching.
//!
//! Slots are enumerated by mixed radix rather than drawn randomly, so each
//! fact's (component, descriptor, qualifier) triple is unique by construction
//! up to `MAX_PER_KIND`. The seed permutes the vocabularies, so runs differ
//! without ever colliding.
